## About

_P6Dx_ provides a platform for leveraging language workflow tools in any text editor.  The included `p6dx` bin script provides several flags with easy access to:

  * Code completions (per file, per package, even required packages)
  * Syntax checking (cascading rule declarations)
  * And more? (Code coverage? ctags? let me know!)

## Usage
### Install

```
panda install p6dx
```
```
zef install p6dx
```
### Config

Mostly TBD.  You will be able to specify syntax rules in either a user's home folder, the project's base path, a manually supplied file, or via a special comment syntax.

# Contributing

I'm gonna try and keep some high-level issues for each feature.  Right now, I mostly need help hashing out conventions and solving bugs in my really early code.  Feel free to submit PRs too though!
